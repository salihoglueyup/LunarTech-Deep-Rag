## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of LunarTech Deep RAG very seriously, especially given its capabilities to connect to SQL databases and execute background web tasks.

If you discover a security vulnerability within LunarTech, please DO NOT report it by opening a public GitHub Issue.

Instead, please send an email to the core maintainers at `security@metazon.com`. We will strive to acknowledge your report within 48 hours and will provide a timeline for a patch.

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- A detailed description of the issue.
- The version of LunarTech you are running.
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
- Any potential impact on data integrity or authentication (e.g., Supabase RLS bypasses).
